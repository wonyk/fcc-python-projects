# Free Code Camp Python Projects

This repository contains the source code for the various completed Python projects listed on the Free Code Camp website.

They are all MIT licenced with the source code available on `Github` and on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@wonyk99).

To view the demo, you may run the code on `repl.it` or simply fork the project from there.

## Project Links

They are split into their respective folders, consisting of scientific computing, data analysis and machine learning with Python.

### Scientific Computing with Python

- Arithmetic Arranger - Format arithmetic strings to have a beautiful arrangement for easy viewing, solving and verifying of answers. ([source](Scientific-Computing/fcc-arithmetic-arranger), [demo](https://repl.it/@wonyk99/fcc-arithmetic-arranger))
- Time Calculator - Add time easily by giving it a start time and day and it will return you the answer. ([source](Scientific-Computing/fcc-time-calculator), [demo](https://repl.it/@wonyk99/fcc-time-calculator))
- Budget App - A lightweight python app to keep track of your expenses with the use of a ledger. ([source](Scientific-Computing/fcc-budget-app), [demo](https://repl.it/@wonyk99/fcc-budget-app))
- Polygen Area Calculator - Create and perform calculations on rectangles and squares. ([source](Scientific-Computing/fcc-shape-calculator), [demo](https://repl.it/@wonyk99/fcc-shape-calculator))
- Probability Calculator - Why learn statistics when you can simple simulate a huge number of randomly occuring events to estimate the probability? ([source](Scientific-Computing/fcc-probability-calculator), [demo](https://repl.it/@wonyk99/fcc-probability-calculator))

### Data Analysis with Python

- Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator - An introduction to numpy by displaying relevant statistics when presented with a 3 x 3 grid. ([source](Data-Analytics/mean-variance-stddev-calculator), [demo](https://replit.com/@wonyk99/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator))
- Demographic Data Analyzer - Analyse and perform various calculations using numpy and pandas. ([source](Data-Analytics/demographic-data-analyser), [demo](https://replit.com/@wonyk99/demographic-data-analyzer))
- Medical Data Visualizer - Showcase medical data and relevant statistics using a catplot and correlation matrix. ([source](Data-Analytics/medical-data-visualiser), [demo](https://replit.com/@wonyk99/medical-data-visualizer))
- Page View Time Series Visualizer - Visualize data from Free Code Camp regarding the number of page views over the years and perform various visualization techniques using matplotlib and seaborn. ([source](Data-Analytics/page-view-time-series-visualiser), [demo](https://replit.com/@wonyk99/page-view-time-series-visualizer))
- Sea Level Predictor - Use scipy to perform basic linear regression and chart out the predicted sea levels in 2050 using matplotlib. ([source](Data-Analytics/sea-level-predictor), [demo](https://replit.com/@wonyk99/sea-level-predictor))

### Machine Learning with Python

- Rock Paper Scissors - Use old school machine learning algorithm such as a Markov chain to beat other players in the game. ([source](Machine-Learning/rock-paper-scissors), [demo](https://replit.com/@wonyk99/rock-paper-scissors#main.py))
- Cat and Dog Image Classifier - Using Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images with high accuracy. ([source](Machine-Learning/cat-and-dog-classifier), [demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O9gu1ZktSE9jLAF2a8VUmp3ZDWeI4rM1?usp=sharing))
- Book Recommendation Engine - Using deep learning to build a simple recommendation engine based on Content-Based and Collaborative filtering methods ([source](Machine-Learning/book-recommendation-engine), [demo]())
- Linear Regression Health Cost Calculator - Using deep learning to build a calculator using linear regression. ([source](Machine-Learning/health-cost-calculator), [demo]())
- Neural Network SMS Text Classifier - A simple Nueral network built using simple Natural Language Processing tools and methodologies to predict if an SMS is spam or not. ([source](Machine-Learning/sms-text-classifier), [demo]())
