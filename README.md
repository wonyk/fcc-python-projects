# Free Code Camp Python Projects

This repository contains the source code for the various completed Python projects listed on the Free Code Camp website.

They are all MIT licenced with the source code available on `Github` and on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@wonyk99).

To view the demo, you may run the code on `repl.it` or simply fork the project from there.

## Project Links

They are split into their respective folders, consisting of scientific computing, data analysis and machine learning with Python.

### Scientific Computing with Python

- Arithmetic Arranger - Format arithmetic strings to have a beautiful arrangement for easy viewing, solving and verifying of answers. ([source](Scientific-Computing/fcc-arithmetic-arranger), [demo](https://repl.it/@wonyk99/fcc-arithmetic-arranger))
- Time Calculator - Add time easily by giving it a start time and day and it will return you the answer. ([source](Scientific-Computing/fcc-time-calculator), [demo](https://repl.it/@wonyk99/fcc-time-calculator))
- Budget App - A lightweight python app to keep track of your expenses with the use of a ledger. ([source](Scientific-Computing/fcc-budget-app), [demo](https://repl.it/@wonyk99/fcc-budget-app))
- Polygen Area Calculator - Create and perform calculations on rectangles and squares. ([source](Scientific-Computing/fcc-shape-calculator), [demo](https://repl.it/@wonyk99/fcc-shape-calculator))
- Probability Calculator - Why learn statistics when you can simple simulate a huge number of randomly occuring events to estimate the probability? ([source](Scientific-Computing/fcc-probability-calculator), [demo](https://repl.it/@wonyk99/fcc-probability-calculator))
