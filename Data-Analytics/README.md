# Data Analytics with Python

This section contains all the projects completed as part of Free Code Camp's Data Analytics segment.

## Libraries used

Various popular data science and anlytics libraries are used:

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)
- [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html)

## Requirements

To get started, you may view or fork the projects in replit, the location where all the coding is done.

Else, to run them manually on your computer, you would require:

- Python3.8 and above
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wonyk/fcc-python-projects.git
cd Data-Analytics/<project name>

poetry init
poetry run python main.py
```
